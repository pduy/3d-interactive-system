This is the implementation of my bachelor thesis in 3d reconstruction and 3d interactive
system, done under the supervision of Dr. Tien Ba Dinh in University of Science in 2013.

All the codes are written in C++ using Point Cloud Library (http://pointclouds.org/).

Functionalities:

* 3D reconstruction using Kinect in real time, resulting in point clouds
* Point cloud manipulation: Adding external objects, removing existing objects and
  restoring the surfaces.

The code can be built using Cmake.
